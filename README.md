# Here's a Year

*A year is a lot smaller than you think.  
This page exists to prove that.*

When you open it, it turns the entire year into **dots**. One dot for one day. All of them fit on a single screen.

- The days you have already spent are **highlighted**.
- The rest are still **waiting**.
- Designed for mobile.

At the bottom, you see how many days are left and how much of the year is already gone.

*I made this to keep myself reminded: No wait, time's short!*
